<abstract>This dataset represents the availability of wireline broadband Internet access in Rhode Island via "Cable Modem - Other" technology. Broadband availability is summarized at the census block level using the US Census Bureau's 2010 decennial census measurement areas. These data were compiled by Broadband Rhode Island (http://broadband.ri.gov) in support of the National Telecommunications and Infrastructure Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Initiative (http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/sbdd). Broadband is considered to be available within a census block if a facilities-based provider of broadband service currently serves at least one location within the block, or can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics to at least one location within the block within 7 - 10 business days. For each census block, the provider name and the respective technologies they provide are represented. In addition, general categories for maximum advertised upload and download speeds are also reported for most provider / technology type / census block combinations.</abstract>
<purpose>These data were created in support of Broadband Rhode Island to depict broadband infrastructure and connectivity in Rhode Island.</purpose>

Cable Modem - Other wireline broadband technology definition:
"Cable modem service enables high-speed Internet access using the same coaxial cables that deliver cable TV programming. Users can access the Internet without disrupting cable TV service. "Cable Modem - Other" refers to cable modems which utilize versions of DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications) other than the current standard, DOCSIS 3.0."
(Definition credit: NTIA National Broadband Map Broadband Classroom, http://www.broadbandmap.gov/classroom/technology.  Date last access: 2 October 2012.)
"Broadband" refers to a high-speed, always-on connection to the Internet. For information to be included on the National Broadband Map, the technology must provide a two-way data transmission (to and from the Internet) with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (Kbps) downstream and at least 200 Kbps upstream to end users. (Source: NTIA, http://broadbandmap.gov/classroom, last date accessed: 27 September 2012). A ''broadband service'' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. An "end user" of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not ''end users'' for this purpose. An entity is considered a "facilities based" provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. A broadband service is considered "available" at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

<dataqual>
<attracc>
<attraccr>Attribute information is populated by the providers and to date has not been changed without their approval. Broadband Rhode Island is performing broadband speed test and dead zone reporting to help verify the accuracy of the data being provided. A comparison and analysis between the attribute data and the speed test/dead zone reports is available through Broadband Rhode Island and is provided to the NTIA as part of the broadband report.</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>The census block data are logically consistent with the location of the broadband services being provided. Spatial analysis checks have been performed on each provider's service area. Once the analysis is preformed inconsistencies are reported to the data provider. To date the data have only been corrected if the provider agrees that a change is needed.</logic>
<complete>Census block level data were provided for all identified wireline providers in the state of Rhode Island. However, not all of the providers included complete data attributes for the census block coverage. Additionally, not all providers knew their entire coverage area and were only able to provide the coverage areas where they have customers. So for some providers this dataset does not represent their complete potential coverage area, rather only where customers currently exist. This dataset will never be considered 100% complete unless the providers decide to provide Broadband Rhode Island with all of their repective coverage area information.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>Census block coverage area information is supplied by the providers and matched to the US census data information. The census block location is 100% accurate. Logical analysis checks were performed by RIEDC in coordination with the providers to help assure data accuracy for coverage areas.</horizpar>
</horizpa>
</posacc>
<lineage>
<procstep>
<procdesc>Providers reported their coverage area in text file format. The data was then converted to a database table and joined to the census block layer to get a spatial attribute. Coverage areas with speeds below broadband ranges were then removed from the dataset. The provider's census block dataset was then loaded into the data transfer model. Spatial analysis was performed to look for logical gaps in the data. Speed test information was also collected and analyzed against the provider's coverage data. Any discrepancies found are reported to the provider as possible changes to their data. Changes are not made unless the provider tells Broadband Rhode Island that the correction should be made.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Broadband wireline provider data extracted, summarized, and exported to a series of flat shapefiles. Metadata adapted for RIGIS data distribution from metadata originally written by EA Engineering staff and provided with the associated semiannual data submission to the NTIA. The census blocks represented in this dataset do not represent all census blocks in Rhode Island. Census blocks that represent offshore areas in Block Island Sound, Narragansett Bay, and Rhode Island's coastal salt ponds were removed prior to joining and subsequently processing wireline broadband data collected by Broadband Rhode Island.</procdesc>
